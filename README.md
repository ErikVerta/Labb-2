This is my second assignment in the c# course. It's a simple store made as a console app. Your are able to create a new account, log in, add items to cart, change currency and go to checkout. I've also implemented discount system where customers can be either gold/silver/bronze or basic customer and receive a discount based on what type of customer they are.
